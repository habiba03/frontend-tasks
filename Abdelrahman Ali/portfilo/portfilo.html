                    <p>Virtual environments with puzzles, complex simulations, or dynamic scenarios are ideal for assessing analytical ability, prioritisation, and effective decision-making under time constraints.

                    They show how participants process information, identify patterns, and discard inefficient options. These skills are critical in project management, customer service during crises, or agile production settings.

                    <p>Some video games to assess skills measure responses to rapidly changing environments or resource-limited situations. They challenge players to adapt constantly, reorganise priorities, and find strategies to reach objectives, highlighting time management and adaptability.
                    Creative games reward original solutions, making them valuable for assessing divergent thinking and innovation—essential in roles linked to design, marketing, and strategic problem-solving </p>
